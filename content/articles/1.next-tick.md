# NextTick in Vue 3

Changing Vue component data (_props_ or _state_) does not immediately change the DOM. Rather, Vue updates the DOM **asynchronously**. You can catch the moment when Vue updates the DOM using the `nextTick()` function.

## Flow

The `nextTick` occurs after the view has been updated, i.e. some state has been changed and replaced in the DOM, but before the re-render - reloading the UI. **It is not yet visible but already updated.**

## `nextTick()`

As component data changes, the DOM is updated **asynchronously**. Vue collects multiple updates to the virtual DOM from all components, and then creates a single batch of changes to update the DOM with it.

Updating the DOM in a single batch is more efficient than performing many small updates.

For example, consider a component that toggles the display of an element:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const show = ref(true)
const content = ref()

const handleClick = () => {
  show.value = !show.value
  console.log(show.value, content.value)
}
</script>
<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="handleClick">Insert/Remove</button>
    <div v-if="show" ref="content">I am an element</div>
  </div>
</template>
```

Clicking the "Insert/Remove" button changes the `show` flag, which toggles the display of the `<div id="content">` element using the `v-if="show"` directive.

Looking at `handleClick`, right after mutating the `show.value = !show.value` data, the implemented DOM data does not match the `show` value. If `show` is true, then content is `null`: which means that the DOM is not synchronized with the component data.

If you want to catch the moment when the DOM has just been updated, you need to use the special function `nextTick(callback)`. It performs a callback after new data reaches the DOM.

Let's find the moment when a `<div>` element is inserted or removed from the DOM:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, nextTick } from 'vue'
const show = ref(true)
const content = ref()
const handleClick = () => {
  show.value = !show.value
  // ---------------
  nextTick(() => {
    console.log(show.value, content.value)
  })
  // ---------------
}
</script>
<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="handleClick">Insert/Remove</button>
    <div v-if="show" ref="content">I am an element</div>
  </div>
</template>
```

You can see that `content` (a reference that contains the `<div>` element) is `null` or contains an element that exactly matches the `show` value.

In addition, `nextTick(callback)` performs a callback when all updates to the child components have been passed to the DOM.

## `nextTick()` with `async/await`

If nextTick() is called without arguments:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, nextTick } from 'vue'
const show = ref(true)
const content = ref()
const handleClick = async () => {
  show.value = !show.value
	// ---------
  await nextTick()
	// ---------
  console.log(show.value, content.value)
}
</script>
<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="handleClick">Insert/Remove</button>
    <div v-if="show" ref="content">I am an element</div>
  </div>
</template>
```

will return a promise that resolves when the component data reaches the DOM - it will be updated but over-rendered.

This helps take advantage of the more readable `async/await` syntax.

For example, we make the previous component more readable by capturing the DOM update using the async/await syntax:

`const handleClick = async () => {...}` has been marked as an asynchronous function.

When the Insert/Remove button is clicked, the `show` value changes.

The `await nextTick()` waits until the changes reach the DOM - update. Finally, `console.log(content)` logs the actual contents of the ref.


## Summary
When we change the component data, Vue updates the DOM **asynchronously**. If we want to catch the moment when the DOM has been updated after the component data has been changed - but not yet redrawn, then we need to use the `nextTick(callback)` function.

Their single argument which is *callback* is called immediately after the DOM update and we are guaranteed to get the **next** DOM in sync with the component data.

Alternatively, if you don't pass the callback argument to `nextTick()`: functions will return a promise that will be resolved when the DOM is updated.
